    """Returns a method that applies a Graph Convolution layer.

    Graph Convolutional layer as in https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.02907,

    NOTE: This implementation does not add an activation after aggregation.
    If you are stacking layers, you may want to add an activation between
    each layer.

    Args:
      update_node_fn: function used to update the nodes. In the paper a single
        layer MLP is used.
      aggregate_nodes_fn: function used to aggregates the sender nodes.
      add_self_edges: whether to add self edges to nodes in the graph as in the
        paper definition of GCN. Defaults to False.
      symmetric_normalization: whether to use symmetric normalization. Defaults
        to True. Note that to replicate the fomula of the linked paper, the
        adjacency matrix must be symmetric. If the adjacency matrix is not
        symmetric the data is prenormalised by the sender degree matrix and post
        normalised by the receiver degree matrix.

    Returns:
      A method that applies a Graph Convolution layer.
