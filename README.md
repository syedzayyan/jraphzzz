# Jraphzzz - A library for graph neural networks in jax. This is a fork of the DeepMind Jraph library. 

No connections to DeepMind whatsoever, except stealing all of their code. Horrible name (?): Jraphzzz, the extended Zs because the original Jraph library has gone to sleep. Geddit (?) Sorry I'll shut up.

This is not a spiritual successor to Jraph. It is Jraph with additional code to make life easier for especially me. The intention is still the same as Graph_nets and Jraph. 

- Keep things simple 
- Help to write GNNs however you want, instead of forcing a certain way
- This still being an extemely forkable repo

If you want a Pytorch Geometric like Jax Graph library JraphX is your friend.

Feel free to contribute, use any part of the code.
