# Jraphzzz - A library for graph neural networks in jax. This is a fork of the DeepMind Jraph library. 

No connections to DeepMind whatsoever, except stealing all of their code. Horrible name (?): Jraphzzz, the extended Zs because the original Jraph library has gone to sleep. Geddit (?) Sorry I'll shut up.

Feel free to contribute, use any part of the code.
