Welcome to Jraph's documentation!
=================================

Jraphzzz (pronounced "giraffe is sleeping") is a lightweight library for working with graph
neural networks in jax. It is a fork of the DeepMind jax library. 
It provides a data structure for graphs, a set of
utilites for working with graphs, and a 'zoo' of forkable graph neural network
models.

Overview
--------

Jraph is designed to provide utilities for working with graphs in jax, but
doesn't prescribe a way to write or develop graph neural networks.

*  ``graph.py`` provides a lightweight data structure, ``GraphsTuple``, for working with graphs.
*  ``utils.py`` provides utilies for working with ``GraphsTuples`` in jax.

   *  Utilities for batching datasets of ``GraphsTuples``.
   *  Utilities to support jit compilation of variable shaped graphs via
      padding and masking.
   *  Utilities for defining losses on partitions of inputs.
*  ``models.py`` provides examples of different types of graph neural network
   message passing. These are designed to be lightweight, easy to fork and
   adapt. They do not manage parameters for you - for that, consider using
   ``haiku`` or ``flax``. See the examples for more details.
